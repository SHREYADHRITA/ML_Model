# ML_Model
This repository contains various models to analyse a linear classification model 
and predict the output using that model

Dataset used for creating this model- 
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/529/early+stage+diabetes+risk+prediction+dataset

The Early Stage Diabetes Risk Prediction model helps identify whether an individual is 
at risk of developing diabetes. By analyzing relevant health data, the model enables 
early detection of potential diabetic conditions, allowing timely treatment. This proactive 
approach can significantly improve health outcomes and reduce long-term complications.

Instuctions to run the code:

Run using the following command ---->
        streamlit run {FILE_PATH}
    For Example - 
        streamlit run D:\github_repo\ML_Model\streamlit_app.py
